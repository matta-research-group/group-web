### Postdoc opening 

We have an opening for a 3-year EPSRC-funded postdoc to work on high-throughput screening and optimisation of mixed ionic/electronic conductors. 

The position is funded by the EPSRC project “Data-driven design of organic mixed conductors”.  
In this project, the candidate will conduct a high throughput computational screening of novel organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors leveraging cheminformatics, quantum chemistry, and molecular dynamics simulations. The candidate will work in close collaboration with experimental groups providing validation/testing of novel mixed conducting materials.
The project has a strong emphasis on software development; the candidate will develop and maintain workflows and datasets related to the project according to FAIR principles. 

For further information, please [reach out to Dr Micaela Matta](mailto:micaela.matta@kcl.ac.uk).
